# Model software
Different pieces of the model use R, Python, and Java. We bundle the appropriate version of each piece of software with the model in this folder.

Upon installation, extract the files in `dependencies64.zip`. This should leave you with the following directories:
- `java8`
- `Python27`
- `R-3.1.2`

And 7za.exe
